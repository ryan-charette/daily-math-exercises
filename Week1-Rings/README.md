## Definition of Rings

A *ring* is a nonempty set $R$ equipped with two binary operations, (usually written as addition and multiplication), such that for all $a,b,c$ in $R$:
1. (Addition is commutative) $a+b=b+a$.
2. (Addition is associative) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$.
3. (Additive has identity) There is an element $0$ in $R$ such that $a+0=a$ for every $a$ in $R$.
4. (Addition is invertible) There exists an element $-a$ in $R$ such that $a+(-a)=0$. 
5. (Multiplication is associative) $a(bc)=(ab)c$. 
6. (Multiplication distributes over addition) $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ and $(a+b)c=ac+bc$.

The element $0$ is called the *additive identity*, and the element $-a$ is called the *additive inverse* of $a$.
