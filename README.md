# Daily Math Exercise Calendar

Welcome to the Daily Math Exercise Calendar! This project is designed to sharpen your mathematical skills with daily exercises, organized into 52 weekly themes spanning topics from analysis, algebra, and topology. Each week progressively builds upon a concept, starting with basics and diving into advanced problems by the end of the week.

## Purpose

The best way to improve at mathematics quickly is to solve exercises. You can use this project to:
- Enhance your understanding of foundational and advanced mathematical concepts.
- Practice problem-solving daily to build a consistent study routine.
- Explore diverse areas of mathematics systematically.

## Project Structure

Currently, this project consists of two files. `main.tex` includes all exercises with solutions, and `no-solutions.tex` includes all exercises without solutions. As the project expands, the plan is to divide the project into 52 folders (one for each week). Each folder will contain:
- `README.md`: A brief introduction to the weekly theme.
- `Day1.tex` through `Day7.tex`: Daily exercises, increasing in difficulty. I'm considering adding `.md` versions as well for people who aren't familiar with TeX.
- Solutions: Hints or solutions for each problem located in a solutions/ folder.

## Weekly Themes

The weekly themes cover a broad spectrum of mathematics from the fields of analysis, algebra, and topology. The difficulty will range from the undergraduate level to the beginning graduate level. I will update this list with the theme each week.
