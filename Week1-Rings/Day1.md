Let $R$ be a ring and let $R\times R$ be the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a,b\in R$. Define addition and multiplication in $R\times R$ by the rules

$$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)\quad\text{and}\quad(a,b)(c,d)=(ac-bd,ad+bc).$$

Prove that with these operations $R$ is a ring. In particular, if $R=$ℝ, then ℂ is a ring.
